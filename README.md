## Interactive Volcano Plots

This project is hosted at [https://a-sol.shinyapps.io/shinyvolcano/](https://a-sol.shinyapps.io/shinyvolcano/ "ShinyApps host link"). 

Currently, this app only works with three specific datasets. In the future, I hope to extend this to be a general framework for interactive volcano plots, but there are only so many hours in a day. 

If you have any questions, just open an issue and I'll lend a hand
