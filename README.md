## Interactive Volcano Plots

Currently, this project is hosted at [https://a-sol.shinyapps.io/shinyvolcano/](https://a-sol.shinyapps.io/shinyvolcano/ "ShinyApps host link"). 

Currently, this app is only designed to work with two specific datasets and one colorscheme. How ever, it will probably be extended at some point in the future.

In a (potentially misguided) effort to reduce load times and protect data, all gene names for the DESeq2 DEA results have been stripped, with the exception of those that are labeled on the plot.
