## Interactive Volcano Plots

This project is hosted at [https://a-sol.shinyapps.io/shinyvolcano/](https://a-sol.shinyapps.io/shinyvolcano/ "ShinyApps host link"). 

This app is designed to allow users to explore differential expression analysis results in an interactive fashion. The app comes with three datasets, but users are able to upload their own as a .csv file.

To use this app with your own data, upload a .csv file containing differential expression data. The file must contain three columns, labeled "gene", "log2FoldChange", and "padj" containing gene names, fold change information, and the adjusted p-value, respectively.

An example is included in the git repo: "ExampleUserInput.csv".
